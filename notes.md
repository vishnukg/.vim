# Create a file using nerd tree

First, bring up NERDTree and navigate to the directory where you want to create the new file. Press m to bring up the NERDTree Filesystem Menu. This menu allows you to create, rename, and delete files and directories. Type a to add a child node and then simply enter the filename. Youâ€™re done! To create a directory follow the same steps but append a / to the filename.

# Json formatting from vim

if you have a json file which is opened in a buffer, you can format it by typing
':%jq .' in the command mode. % sign indicates that the contents of the buffer is piped into the command following the % sign (in this case jq) and after processing the result, the result is pasted back into the same buffer. Really neat :)

First, go to the first line you want to comment, press CtrlV. This will put the editor in the VISUAL BLOCK mode.
Then using the arrow key and select until the last line
Now press ShiftI, which will put the editor in INSERT mode and then press #. This will add a hash to the first line.
Then press Esc (give it a second), and it will insert a # character on all other selected lines.

For the stripped-down version of vim shipped with debian/ubuntu by default, type : s/^/# in the third step instead (any remaining highlighting of the first character of each line can be removed with :nohl).

# Copying and pasting across sessions in vim

SHIFT + v puts you in select lines mode. Then "\*y yanks the currently selected line to the \* register which is the clipboard. There are quite a few different registers, for different purposes.
